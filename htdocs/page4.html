				<h3>Is it good? Is it bad?: Website Creator's Insights and Opinions</h3>
				<p>As a student from a science high school, I stand with science and all its areas: this includes biotechnology, and specifically, genetic engineering.</p>

					<h4>Genetic Engineering Animation</h4>

					<p>It is true that genetic engineering is still not that safe. It really isn't. Like other tests and experiments, there is no guarantee that the subject will be better after recombination of their DNA. But, this does not mean that scientists and researchers should stop here. Perfection of the techniques used in genetic engineering may be obtained through continuous researches and practices.</p>
					<p>Genetic engineering in crop production is very useful as it increases resistance of crops to diseases and pests, therefore lowering the production cost. They can be modified to live a longer shelf life, which makes them easier to transport. It will also reduce the use of pesticides and herbicides, reducing the chemicals that are mixed with said crops. Crops can be modified to have higher yields resulting to more efficient lands and farmers. It can also help in growing of herb medicines.</p>
					<p>For animals, the result of a successful genetic modification can lead to a great improvement on the resistance to diseases. In fact, genetic engineering already plays a great role on vaccine production: and whether it is deemed unsafe by the citizens or not, it does not erase the fact that it is useful, especially given our situation at the moment.</p>

			<p>I personally don't think that letting go of genetic engineering is even an option given all the pros it has. As we all strive for better lives, genetic engineering may just be the right key to having control of what we have and what we are. There are already a lot of benefits that it has offered, and there will be a lot more if the public supports it. A technology so useful cannot be thrown away so easily just because it is not safe. It is also important to note that safety is still the number one priority of those who are involved, as there is even an entire committee dedicated to checking the facilities of all biotechnology-related researches even before it is actually held.</p>
