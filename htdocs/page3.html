			<p>Ever since the first product of organism manipulation, genetic engineering, or biotechnology as a whole, has been a great help, especially in improving our lives. However, as biotechnology takes a step towards a new age, it gains an increasing number of protesters. But what are people really against? And those scientists and researchers that continue on perfecting these techniques, what do they really want to achieve?</p>

				<h2>Listed below are the pros and cons of genetic engineering:</h2>
				<h3>Pros of Genetic Engineering</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Defeating and Curing Diseases: Disease-causing viruses tend to mutate really fast since they reproduce quickly. These mutations are the sole reasons why treating said diseases is difficult: a new variant tends to resist the treatment. With the help of genetic engineering, we can intervene with the next generation, stopping the problem from going too far.</li>
					<li>Getting Rid of Illnesses of Fetuses: By modifying a fetus' genome, one can prevent a certain disease from occuring while the baby is still unborn. This does not only stop the future child from suffering a disease, it also (a) lessens the worries of adults suffering inheritable diseases; and (b) cuts the line of these heritable diseases, preventing later generations from suffering.</li>
					<li>Producing New Foods: Genetically-modified foods are starting to get more and more approval from the health sectors. Some of these include: (a) BT crops, specifically, BT corn, which was genetically modified by adding a gene from <span>Bacillus thuringiensis</span>, enabling them to produce toxins against pests; and (b) Golden Rice, rice that is genetically modified by adding beta-carotene, a yellowish pigment that our bodies digest into Vitamin A, a vitamin that people in poor countries lack.</li>
					<li>Plant Modification: Plants can be modified with the help of genetic engineering in a sense that they may be made to absorb more carbon dioxide. Less carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would reduce the problems surrounding global warming as its threat decreases. Genetic engineering can also be used for increasing the growth rates of plants, as well as their survival rates in harsh conditions.</li>

				<h3>Cons of Genetic Engineering</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Risky In All Aspects: Some of the growing concerns against genetic engineering stems from its riskiness, may that be in terms of nutritional value or other side effects. Take in the case of golden rice and BT corn, there have been some concerns on whether they would be allergenic.</li>
					<li>Negative Side Effects: Nature is a complex chain of reactions and interactions of organisms. A modification in an organism may not only change its behavior in a particular aspect, it may change its behavior as a whole. </li>
					<li>Is it right? Can it go too far?: According to Eisenberg and Schenker, gene therapy should only be used "in ways that maintain human dignity". For some, however, they see genetic engineering as insults to the creation of their higher being (or their gods).</li>

			<h5>For this section, I would like to focus on the safety regulations that have been established in relation to the growing spread of genetically modified organisms (GMOs).</h5>
			<h4>Biosafety Regulations in the Philippines Regarding Biotechnology</h4>
			<p>1990: The National Committee on Biosafety of the Philippines (NCBP) was given the responsibility of "identifying and evaluating potential hazards in genetic engineering experiments". The NCBP is an interdepartmental committee consisting of the Department of Agriculture (DA), Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), Department of Health (DOH), and Department of Science and Technology (DOST).</p>
			<p>The NCBP has a list of guidelines to be followed from proposals to actual researches. Procedures are different based on what kind of research is to be done (may be contained facility research or field tests). For both cases, a proposal must be submitted, a meeting for queries be held, as well as inspections of sites and facilities, all of which reviewed by the IBC (Institutional Biosafety Committees) before it is passed to the NCBP (and if needed, the STRP or Scientific and Technical Review Panels). For the case of field tests, posting of NCBP-approved information sheet in at least three places in the barangay where the field test will be done is a requirement, plus a news publication surrounding this before the research is started.</p>
			<p>These steps before a research under new biotechnology is held is one of the many requirements to ensure the safety of everyone involved, whether they are the research team themselves or locals living near the research facility.</p>
